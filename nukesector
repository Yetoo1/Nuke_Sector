.SH DESCRIPTION
//remember to fix This is a turn based resource strategy game in which you start with nothing, no one wants ware but you, you can trade and shit with the other sectors, but it's much more enjoyable to watch the world burn. Now if you fuck with someone else and entise them to strike, they will based on their defense and resources. The chaos meter can raise if people caused such strikes(during and after), but it is not limited to strikes. Also disagreements can cause the tiniest panty to be in a wad. The more the meter is raised, the better chance of sectors moving around. Striking someone or someone striking you will automatically raise the meter by a whole decimal. The maximum is 10 chaos. There also can be allies and such that  can determine chaos, but watching the world burn is much more fun. Emphasize on sector destruction. The time it takes for the missles to reach the destination is a factor in the strategy. The goal is to either destroy them all and survive the period of aftermath (although requiring the unfun part of the game to be emphasized).
